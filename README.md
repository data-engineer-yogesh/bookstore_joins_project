# Bookstore Joins Project

##  Overview
The **Bookstore Joins Project** is a SQL learning mini-project designed to help you master **all major SQL JOIN types** through practical, real-world scenarios using a bookstore database.  

It includes 6 tables — `authors`, `books`, `customers`, `orders`, `order_items`, and `deliveries` (optional extension) — and 10 carefully crafted queries that cover every JOIN type with business use cases.
